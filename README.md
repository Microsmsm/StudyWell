# StudyWell
an Android PhoneGap Application for Study

Study well makes u study with full brain concentration using Pomodoro Technique.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo.
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

In this app u can:

1. Decide on the task to be done
2. Set the pomodoro timer to n minutes (traditionally 25)
3. Work on the task until the timer rings; record with an x
4. Take a short break (3–5 minutes)
5. After four pomodori, take a longer break (15–30 minutes)

Productivity is waiting you :) ^_^ !
Study well !
